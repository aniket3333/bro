## Introduction

**Problem Statement:**

1. **Utilizing Bootstrap Modal for Form Submission to Maakeetoo:**

   In this project, I have implemented a modal component from Bootstrap. When a user clicks on the "Sign Up for Free" button within the price cards, this modal will open. The objective is to submit the form data to the following Maakeetoo link: "https://forms.maakeetoo.com/formsdata/535."

2. **Lighthouse Performance Analysis:**

   As part of this project, I will demonstrate the usage of Lighthouse within the developer tools to provide insights into the page loading process. This will include detailed information on page loading speed, performance, and other relevant metrics.

3. **Implementation of Lazy Loading Concept:**

   To enhance the user experience, I have implemented the concept of lazy loading using vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, I have integrated a mock API to retrieve data. The aim is to optimize the loading of content, ensuring that only the necessary data is fetched and displayed, thus improving overall page performance.




### Prerequisites

Before you can successfully clone and run the project on your local machine, there are several prerequisites you should have in place:

1. **Git**
download link : https://git-scm.com/downloads
 You can verify if Git is installed by running `git --version` in your command prompt or terminal.

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: 
download link : https://code.visualstudio.com/download
 

3. **Live Server Extension (Optional)**: If you plan to use the "Open with Live Server" feature in VS Code to run your project, you should have the "Live Server" extension installed. You can install it directly from the VS Code extensions marketplace.

4. **Internet Connection**: Ensure that your computer has an active internet connection to access the GitLab repository and download any dependencies that the project might have.

5. **Browser**: You'll need a web browser to view and interact with your project. Any modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge will work.



## Getting Started
Certainly! Here are the steps to clone the repository and run it on your local machine with more details and correct English:

**Steps to Clone and Run the Project on Your Local Machine:**

1. **Copy the Repository Link:**

   First, copy the link to the GitLab repository. You can find the repository link on the GitLab website. In this example, the repository link i(https://gitlab.com/anikethiware3/price.git)

2. **Open Your Command Prompt or Terminal:**

   Launch your command prompt or terminal on your local machine. You can usually find this by searching for "Command Prompt" (Windows) or "Terminal" (macOS/Linux) in your system's search bar.

3. **Clone the Repository:**

   Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository link to clone the project to your local machine. For example:

   
   git clone https://gitlab.com/anikethiware3/price.git
   

   This command will download the project files to your current directory.

4. **Change to the Project Directory:**

   Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example:

   
   cd price
   

   Now you are inside the project folder.

5. **Open Visual Studio Code:**

   If you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed, you can open the project by running the `code .` command in your terminal. This will open the project folder in VS Code.

6. **Start a Live Server:**

   In VS Code, locate the `index.html` file in your project folder. Right-click on it, and you should see an option to "Open with Live Server." Click on that option.

   This will launch a live development server that will host your project locally. It will automatically open a web browser window with the project loaded. You can see your changes in real-time as you edit the code.

7. **Project Is Ready:**

   Congratulations! You have successfully cloned the repository, opened it in Visual Studio Code, and started a live server to run the project locally. You can now begin working on the project or exploring its contents.

   If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure you have Git and Visual Studio Code installed and that you're in the correct project directory before starting the live server.
